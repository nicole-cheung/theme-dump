# theme-dump
Old Tumblr theme. An example rendition of the HTML file is shown in example1.png. The user would have copied the entire HTML code into Tumblr's online IDE. Colors, post size, pagination, etc. are all customizable within the native Tumblr editing interface. Note that the navigation is intentionally blurred until hover. WARNING: This theme is depreciated as of 2017.
